<pre class="example"><code>STATS STRUC CHANGE DEPENDENT=y INDEPENDENT=x1 x2 x3
TESTS=CUSUMREC CUSUMOLS
/OPTIONS PLOT=YES SCTEST=YES.
</code></pre>

<p>Example with CHOW test and time series:</p>

<pre class="examplenobefore"><code>STATS STRUC CHANGE DEPENDENT=y INDEPENDENT=x1 x2 x3
CHOW = YES FROM=2000 2 TO=2002 4
/OPTIONS START = 1995 4 PERIODICITY=4.
</code></pre>

<p><strong>DEPENDENT</strong> and <strong>INDEPENDENT</strong> name the variables in the linear model.
Categorical variables are automatically converted to R factors.
If no independent variables are named, the tests are based on the dependent
variable alone, i.e., it is as if that variable were regressed on a a constant.</p>

<p><strong>FLUCTESTS</strong> names one or more tests for structural change. 
The tests are as follows.
The first four calculate an empirical process of sums of residuals.  They
are based on recursive residuals or OLS residuals (REC or OLS)
The sums are either cumulative or for a moving data window (CUSUM or MOSUM).
The remaining two are based on recursive estimates of the regression
coefficients or moving OLS estimates.</p>

<p><strong>CHOW</strong> specifies a CHOW test.  If used, the <strong>FROM</strong> and <strong>TO</strong> parameters must be specified.
The CHOW F statistic is calculated for each point between FROM and TO, and a test
is performed based on the maximum F statistic.  In the associated plot, the labeling on
the x axis shows the second component in a date as the fraction of the period.  That is,
with quarterly data rather than seeing 1,2,3,4 as the second component, you might see <code>0, .25., .50, .75.</code></p>

<p>The <strong>BANDWIDTH</strong> determines the size of the window for moving residuals or estimates.
it is expressed as a fraction between 0 and 1 and defaults to .15, i.e., 15% of the
sample.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS</h2>

<p><strong>PLOT</strong> and <strong>SCTEST</strong> determine whether plots and test statistics are displayed.
By default, both are displayed.  PLOT=NO SCTEST=NO is an error as there
would be no output.</p>

<p><strong>ALPHA</strong> determines the size of the confidence intervals shown in the plots.
It defaults to .05.</p>

<p><strong>INCLUDELAG</strong> determines whether the lagged dependent variable is included
in the equation.</p>

<p>For time series data, START can specify the initial date as a number, 
e.g., <code>2000</code>, or pair of numbers, e.g., <code>2000 4</code>, and <strong>PERIODICITY</strong> specifies the periodicity.  For example,<br/>
<code>START=2000 3 PERIODICITY=12</code> would define monthly data starting in
year 2000, month 3.  This information is used only for labelling the plots
and interpreting the FROM and TO parameters.</p>

<p>For CHOW tests, <strong>FROM</strong> and <strong>TO</strong> determine the possible location of a structural change.
The values can be specified as dates similar to the START
parameter.  For time series, these can have one or two components.
If FROM and TO are less than 1, they are interpreted as fractions of the sample.
For example, if there are N cases and FROM = .2, the starting value is case N*.2
If data are not declared as time series, FROM and TO are interpreted as case
numbers if they are integers.</p>
